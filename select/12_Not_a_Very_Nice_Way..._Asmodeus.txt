Warm dampy sweat engulfing you
There's no doubt in what we're gonna do
The reason why no fuckin' clue
We're gonna leave you black and blue

Go forth and multiply
The divine decision
We will stop at nothing
To fulfil our mission

Senile men with just one goal
A thousand dicks tear up your soul
Senile psycho's on the role

Senile psycho's with no remorse
We'll be bangin' you on all fours
Senile psycho's run down your door

Come on now you know it's true
If you want it you can have it too
Enjoy the bangin' of the senile crew
